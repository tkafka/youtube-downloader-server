# Youtube downloader

Really simple youtube downloader as a expresss-powered website using [ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core).

Pass youtube url in ?url=... parameter (to directly call eg. from bookmarklet).

When there isn't a valid youtube video url in `url` parameter, displays an input form.

## Install and run

> yarn

> npm start

Set up port like this

> PORT=3001 npm start
